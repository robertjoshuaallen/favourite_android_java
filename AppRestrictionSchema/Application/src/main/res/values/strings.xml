            This sample shows how to use app restrictions. This application has one boolean
            restriction with a key \"can_say_hello\" that defines whether the only feature of this
            app (press the button to show \"Hello\" message) is enabled or disabled. Use
            AppRestrictionEnforcer sample to toggle the restriction.
